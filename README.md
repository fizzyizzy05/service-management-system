# Service management system
This service management system was created as part of a university assignment. It handles users, appointments and services handled by a hypothetical company.
## Initialisation
When the database is initialised, it is created in a hotel-database.db in the project's root directory. This contains empty versions of the appointments and services tables, whilst adding an admin user to the Users database to intialise the system. The default username is 'admin@localhost' and password is 'admin', and users will be asked to change the password on first setup for security reasons (or any other time this password is used). It is recommended to use a strong and secure password.
